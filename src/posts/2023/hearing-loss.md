Recently [≈Åukasz Olejnik](https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik) posted [a blog post about his life with hearing impairment](https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/invisible-disability-in-the-world-of-technology/). Motivated by that and the fact that I also deal with hearing loss, I decided to share my own story. I treat this blogpost as a very personal one but hopefully it will help at least one of you with understanding how the life with this affliction looks like.

### Diagnosis and early life

The first person that had a suspicion that I might have hearing loss was my Polish language teacher in the elementary school when I was around 11 years old. One of the typical activities is [dictation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictation_%28exercise%29), where the teacher reads a text and your task is to write it down correctly. It's meant to verify if you know the ortography and interpunction. During one of those, the teacher noticed that I got some of the words wrong but not because I didn't know how to write them but because I probably misheard them and wrote a completely wrong word.

She shared the observation with my parents and that's how my life story with hearing loss has begun. I had my first hearing tests that, since then, I've done so many times. The most common one is that you sit inside a soundproof cabin, you need to wear headphones and they play sounds with increasing volume and increasing frequency. Your goal is to press a button whenever you can hear the sound. The result is an [audiogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiogram), which is a graph showing the frequencies and intensity (measured in dB). Below I'm sharing two of my audiograms and a graph from Wikipedia that shows what is the expected hearing range. The left audiogram is from 20??, and the right one is the most recent one from 2021.

On the first one you can clearly see that I had a significant loss on higher frequencies.
