Recently [≈Åukasz Olejnik](https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik) posted [a blog post about his life with hearing impairment](https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/invisible-disability-in-the-world-of-technology/). Motivated by that and the fact that I also deal with hearing loss, I decided to share my own story. I treat this blogpost as a very personal one but hopefully it will help at least one of you with understanding how the life with this affliction looks like.

### Diagnosis and audiograms

The first person that had a suspicion that I might have hearing loss was my Polish language teacher in the elementary school when I was around 11 years old. One of the typical activities is [dictation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictation_%28exercise%29), where the teacher reads a text and your task is to write it down correctly. It's meant to verify if you know the ortography and interpunction. During one of those, the teacher noticed that I got some of the words wrong but not because I didn't know how to write them but because I probably misheard them and wrote a completely wrong word.

She shared the observation with my parents and that's how my life story with hearing loss has begun. I had my first hearing tests that, since then, I've done so many times. The most common one is that you sit inside a soundproof cabin, you need to wear headphones and they play sounds with increasing volume and increasing frequency. Your goal is to press a button whenever you can hear the sound. The result is an [audiogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiogram), which is a graph showing the frequencies and intensity (measured in dB). Below I'm sharing two of my audiograms: one from 2001 (one of the first ones I ever got) and from 2021 (the latest one).

![Audiogram from 2001 showing hearing loss at frequencies higher than 3kHz](/hearing-loss/audiogram2001.jpg "Audiogram from 2001")

![Audiogram from 2021 showing hearing loss pretty much at all frequencies](/hearing-loss/audiogram2021.jpg "Audiogram from 2021")

According to Wikipedia, people with "normal" hearing are expected to have their results within the range -10dB - 20dB. Also, by convention, right ear is graphed in red, while the left ear is graphed in blue.

Keeping that in mind, on the 2001 audiogram you can clearly see a significant deteroration at frequencies higher than 3kHz and that both ears had fairly similar loss. In 2021 though both of them looks bad pretty much on the whole scale with the left ear being super bad.

When I look at the audiograms from the 20 years between those two I pasted above, there has been a very clear trend that the hearing gets worse and worse over the years. There's always been a gradual decline. Nobody really knew why this has been happening and what can be done to stop it.

This begs another question: when did the hearing loss exactly start? I mentioned that I was first diagnosed when I was 11 but what about the times before that? I've never had any incident in my life that could be directly attributed as a cause of the hearing loss. I've never had any surgery, nor any accident. So nobody knows the answer to the question. Some doctors believe that I have this since I was born and the reason might be genetic. I also think that this condition is with me my entire life; I'll come back to this in the next section where I describe how the hearing loss exactly affects me.

Shortly after my diagnosis I was admitted into the hospital. But long story short, after many tests and examinations the only conclusion was that the reason is unknown and that it is probably not curable. 

My hearing problems don't end with hearing loss though. Another problem I have is tinnitus. I have a very clear memory of when this exactly started. I was in high school, around 17 years old. In between classes I suddenly started hearing a loud noise in my left ear. It hit me like a bolt of lightning. I was very suprised about this thing but I thought it was going to be temporary. How wrong was I! A couple of years later I started to have a tinnitus in right ear too. And those things are with me all the time. Imagine a badly tuned radio that constantly makes background noise. That's what I hear all the time. But I can never turn it off.

The tinnitus is not steady all the time. Sometimes it suddenly gets louder or quieter. Sometimes the frequency I hear suddenly changes. In most cases I cannot attribute this to anything specific. It happens out of the blue. The only case when the tinnitus keeps being louder is after I leave a very loud space. Then the loudness kind of stays with me for some time but gradually wears off.

### How hearing loss affects life

So in the previous section I focused solely on objective matters: the diagnosis, audiograms and symptopms. In this section I'll move on to the very subjective point of view and try to describe how hearing loss affects my life.

Let's start with my childhood. I've already mentioned that I believe I have hearing loss since always. Now during my early childhood I didn't have problems with communication with people. But there are two things I do remember and that I'm pretty sure were early symptoms of the problem. The first one is that I had big problems with understanding songs in cartoons. I was a big fan of cartoons (to be fair, I still enjoy watching them), my favourite one was [Garfield and Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield_and_Friends) which I watched many times (as in: each episodes I watched several times). And there was an intro song (actually two intro songs over the run of the series) that I could never understand fully. There were some verses that I could sing along but not all of them. And that was the case even though I probably heard the intro song more than a 100 times. On different TVs, on different volume levels and so on. There were some passages that I had never been able to get. 

And here's a funny thing: when writing this blog post I found [the aforementioned intro song in Polish on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWWID-43biw) because I was curious if I can understand the lyrics now. And I still could not but the uploader added subtitles! That was a surprise (it's really rare for videos in Polish), and finally, after like 25 years after hearing the song originally, I finally know the exact lyrics. That's pretty incredible, and for this reason alone it was worth it to write this blog post ;)

Going back to the more serious side. Of course Garfield was not the only cartoon where I couldn't understand the lyrics; it happened pretty much to all of them. As a child I didn't really think much about it. I probably thought that it's normal and other people have the same problem I do.

Another issue I remember was listening to radio in a car. Whenever there was any broadcast where people were talking to each other, I had big difficulties in understanding what exactly they said. I didn't have this problem (at least not to this extent) when listening to radio at home, without any background noises.

So the thing that songs and radio have in common is that there was some additional background noise. In those situations the voice of a person doesn't stand out as clearly as in the quiet conditions. 

And this is actually a pretty good summary of how my life with hearing loss looks like. The background noise is my biggest enemy; it makes understanding people significantly harder. And while during the childhood, the background noise had to be quite loud to become an issue, today even mild background sounds are problematic.

The obvious effect of hearing loss is that it severly affects your social interactions.
