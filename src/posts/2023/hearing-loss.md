Recently [≈Åukasz Olejnik](https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik) posted [a blog post about his life with hearing impairment](https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/invisible-disability-in-the-world-of-technology/). Motivated by that and the fact that I also deal with hearing loss, I decided to share my own story. I treat this blogpost as a very personal one but hopefully it will help at least one of you with understanding how the life with this affliction looks like.

### Diagnosis and early life

The first person that had a suspicion that I might have hearing loss was my Polish language teacher in the elementary school when I was around 11 years old. One of the typical activities is [dictation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictation_%28exercise%29), where the teacher reads a text and your task is to write it down correctly. It's meant to verify if you know the ortography and interpunction. During one of those, the teacher noticed that I got some of the words wrong but not because I didn't know how to write them but because I probably misheard them and wrote a completely wrong word.

She shared the observation with my parents and that's how my life story with hearing loss has begun. I had my first hearing tests that, since then, I've done so many times. The most common one is that you sit inside a soundproof cabin, you need to wear headphones and they play sounds with increasing volume and increasing frequency. Your goal is to press a button whenever you can hear the sound. The result is an [audiogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiogram), which is a graph showing the frequencies and intensity (measured in dB). Below I'm sharing two of my audiograms: one from 2001 (one of the first ones I ever got) and from 2021 (the latest one).

![Audiogram from 2001 showing hearing loss at frequencies higher than 3kHz](/hearing-loss/audiogram2001.jpg "Audiogram from 2001")

![Audiogram from 2021 showing hearing loss pretty much at all frequencies](/hearing-loss/audiogram2001.jpg "Audiogram from 2021")

According to Wikipedia, people with "normal" hearing are expected to have their results within the range -10dB - 20dB. Also, by convention, right ear is graphed in red, while the left ear is graphed in blue.

Keeping that in mind, on the 2001 audiogram you can clearly see a significant deteroration at frequencies higher than 3kHz and that both ears had fairly similar loss. In 2021 though both of them looks bad pretty much on the whole scale with the left ear being super bad.
